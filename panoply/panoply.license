Color Tables

The color tables built into Panoply come from several sources. Among them are:

CB. Color tables whose names begin with the prefix "CB" are based on color information obtained from ColorBrewer2.org by Cynthia A. Brewer of the Dept. of Geography at the Pennsylvania State University.

GMT. Color tables whose names begin with "GMT" are based on color schemes from the Generic Mapping Tools software from SOEST at the University of Hawai'i.

NCL. Color tables whose names begin with "NCL" are based on color schemes from the NCL Graphics Color Table Gallery from UCAR.

UO. Color tables whose names begin with "UO" are based on color schemes described by Light & Bartlein of the Dept. of Geography at the University of Oregon.

Some color tables included with the Panoply software package were obtained from J.J. Green's CPT City website. See that site for many more CPT format color tables compatible with Panoply.
Map Overlays

Most coastline and border outline map overlays included in Panoply are based on the Micro World Data Bank II (MWDB II) dataset, originally created by Fred Pospeschil and Antonio Rivera. We use the version dated 2011 which is available for download from Fred Pospeschil's MWDB II website.
